Feature: Generate and Retrieve Excel Financial Report

  As a user of the system
  I want to generate and retrieve an Excel report
  So that I can analyze and work with financial data in a structured and familiar format

  Scenario Outline: Successfully generate and retrieve an Excel report with valid authentication
    Given I am authenticated with a valid session
    When a request is made to the Excel endpoint with the report ID "<id>"
    Then the service should respond with a status code of 200
    And the response should include the Excel file with "<template>" report
    Examples:
      | id                                   | template                                                |

  Scenario: Return an error when attempting to retrieve a report with an unrecognized ID
    Given I am authenticated with a valid session
    When a request is made to the Excel endpoint with the report ID "01010101-0101-0101-0101-010101010101"
    Then the service should respond with a status code of 404
