    Given I am authenticated with a valid session
    When a request is made to the reports endpoint with the report ID "0fbec75b-2d72-44f5-a0e3-2dcb29d92f79"
    Then the service should respond with a status code of 200
    And the response should include details for the report with ID "0fbec75b-2d72-44f5-a0e3-2dcb29d92f79"
